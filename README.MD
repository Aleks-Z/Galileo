This project use/try to follow the gitflow: http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

###On gitflow we do not merge/commit things straight to master, it is done to the 'develop' branch.
So, to contribute, fork this project and checkout to the developer branch to proceed with your updates. The master branch is update over an new plugin official release, while the develop branch receices/stores all the updates which are waiting to be released on the next version. The updates to the develop branch usually done by merging into it, feature branches. Such approaches are well explained on the gitflow tutorials, as the one just above.
